Below I will describe what I observe as I run my protein sequences through BLAST

@author: cmouton


The first sequence I inputted provided a lot of alignment with salmonella enterica,
especially with the ATP sythase SpaL sequence.

I am now searching for the other five sequences that I found, and will look for general
overlays from one to the other as well as make comments about specifics that are seen in each
one.

for my second search, I working within Salmonella enterica again, except this time I am
looking at the needle length control protein, as well as the invasion protein InvJ. The antigen
presentation protein SpaN also has a lot of matches with my searched query.

my third search yielded relationships with the type III secretion system protein, SpaP, for the salmonella
enterica again. It sounds pretty nasty.

my fourth search didn't have nearly as solid of a red block compared to the others. Again working
within salmonella enterica, there are relationships to both the needle complex export protein and 
the type III secretion system protein, SpaR.

my fifth search again relates to a type III secretion system protein, this time looking at SpaO. 
I wonder why we are finding so much of that type of protein. It could possibly be due to the fact 
that those are some of the longest proteins found within salmonella enterica or the section of DNA that 
we are looking at contains the codons for these types of proteins.

my sixth and final search yielded yet another type III secretion system protein. SpaS has a fairly strong similarity
to my submission, but not as strong as some of the others.
